I will be defending my PhD thesis titled "Supermassive black hole dynamics in massive early-type galaxies" on **November 28th 2025 at 13:00 Finnish time (21:00 AEST, 06:00 EST)**.
The defence will be held in E204, Physicum, at Kumpula Campus.
For those unable to join in person, the defence will be streamed at [this web address](https://video.helsinki.fi/unitube/live-stream.html?room=l41).

The thesis can be found [here]({{ site.base_url }}{% link /assets/thesis.pdf %}) for your perusal. 
If you are interested in any of the code used to generate the figures in thesis, they can be found [in the git repository](https://github.com/alex-rawlings/rawlings-phd-thesis).
