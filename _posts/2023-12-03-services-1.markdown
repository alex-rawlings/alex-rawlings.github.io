title: "Featured Article: Binary Eccentricity is Stochastic"

  Computer simulations of galaxy mergers are affected by the discretisation of the phase space: the exact positions and velocities of particles will affect the orbital dynamics of the supermassive black holes in the system. 
  Increasing the number of particles used to represent the galaxy reduces the scatter in the impact parameter, but this does not necessarily translation to a convergence in the SMBH eccentricity. 
  The full details of the study can be found in the article [Reviving stochasticity: uncertainty in SMBH binary eccentricity is unavoidable](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.2688R/abstract).
