  The advent of integral field unit spectroscopy allows us to combine both morphological and kinematic data of galaxies.
  By studying how the ellipticity and spin parameter vary with radius, different galaxy types can be revealed that would not necessarily be distinguishable with just photometry or kinematics alone.
  The full details of the study can be found in the article [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: rules of behaviour for spin-ellipticity radial tracks in galaxies](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..324R/abstract).
