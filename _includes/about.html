              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>I am a doctoral researcher in theoretical extragalactic astrophysics at the <a href="https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/phjohans/group-website/">University of Helsinki</a>, Finland. I completed by undergraduate in physics at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. I then moved to Helsinki to study my Master's in astrophysics, where I have been since.</p>
                <p>I work with computer simulations to model galaxy evolution, and in particular the evolution of the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies. We're trying to understand the dynamics of SMBHs to give predictions for how the gravitational wave emission will look to the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</p>
                <p>Aside from astrophysics, I have a keen interest in statistics. The computer simulations we use generate vast quantities of data, and only with a sound understanding of statistics can we draw actionable conclusions from our data.</p>
